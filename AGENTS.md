# AGENTS

This project uses an instruction file for OpenAI Codex and other automated contributors.
These rules apply to the entire repository unless overridden by nested `AGENTS.md` files.

## Development

- Source lives in `almy.js` with tests in `__test__/`.
- Do **not** edit files in `dist/` directly; they are generated by the build.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies without discussion.

## Style

- Run Prettier before committing. The repo is configured for semicolons and single quotes.
- `npm test` runs Prettier automatically; you may also run `npx prettier --write almy.js __test__/**/*.js`.

## Testing

- Always run `npm test` after making changes. This builds the 
project and executes the Vitest test suite.
- Add or update tests in `__test__/` for any code changes.

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` and other docs when you change the public API or behaviour.

## Misc

- Keep commits focused and include descriptive messages.
- Ensure the working tree is clean before finishing.
